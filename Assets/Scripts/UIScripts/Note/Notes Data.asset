      a code to your door as you asked. \r\nIf you found this note, I'm sorry I didn't
      give you the code in person. \r\nIf we never saw each other again, I hid it
      behind a woman, I think you'll understand. \r\nRegards"

    Content: "The experiment went very badly. All three subjects who were shown the
      contents of the film died of suffocation. \r\nThey all complained of hallucinations
      in which a woman appeared chasing them. Out of curiosity, I also wanted to
      see what was on the tape, but after turning it on I lost consciousness...\r\nThe
      recommended action in the event of the victim's death is to burn the body with
      emotionaly attached object, otherwise the consequences may be tragic. \r\nI
      feel like I don't have much time left, I'm starting to see things. Whoever
      is reading this, the women's bodies are in the morgue, but you need to find
      items to burn with them. \r\nMy item is always with me, so if something goes
      wrong, you know what to do.\r\n\r\nSarah Hong - Teddy Bear\r\nLisa Fox - Gold
