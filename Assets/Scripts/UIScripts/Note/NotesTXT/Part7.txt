The experiment went very badly. All three subjects who were shown the contents of the film died of suffocation. 
They all complained of hallucinations in which a woman appeared chasing them. Out of curiosity, I also wanted to see what was on the tape, but after turning it on I lost consciousness...
The recommended action in the event of the victim's death is to burn the body with emotionaly attached object, otherwise the consequences may be tragic. 
I feel like I don't have much time left, I'm starting to see things. Whoever is reading this, the women's bodies are in the morgue, but you need to find items to burn with them. 
My item is always with me, so if something goes wrong, you know what to do.
